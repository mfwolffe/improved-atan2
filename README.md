# improved-atan2

[Page](https://mfwolffe.github.io/improved-atan2/)

Started Fall 2023 as an attempt to practice with javascript while taking a front-end webdev course. Is essentially an improvement (in my opinion/for my usage, which is quickly checking math students' work) of the standard atan2() function. Modifications added to make more a bit more idiomatic.

Would be nice to add responsive design and other tweaks. However, this project's focus was neither the style nor structure of the page, simply javascript practice.
