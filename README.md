# improved-atan2

<p>Started earlier this semester as an attempt to practice with javascript. Is essentially an improvement (in my opinion/for my usage) of the standard atan2() function. Modifications added to make more canonical.</p>
<p>Need to add responsive design and other tweaks.</p>
<p>Perhaps an option for tabulation of all unit options.</p>
