# improved-atan2

[Page](https://mfwolffe.github.io/improved-atan2/)

<p>
Started earlier this semester as an attempt to practice with javascript while taking front-end web dev course. Is essentially an improvement (in my opinion/for my usage - quickly checking math students' work) of the standard atan2() function. Modifications added to make more canonical.

<p>Need to add responsive design and other tweaks. This project's focus was never the style or structure of the page however.</p>
<p>Perhaps an option for tabulation of all units</p>
